# Latency vs Throughput 

Both latency and troughput are measurements that can be used to assess the speed of data transfers over a network. 


**Latency**

"The time taken for a packet of data to be transfered across a network" 

Can be measured one-way or as a round trip.

Latency is measured in time.

Two factors which can increase latency are the number of routers a packet has to pass through and 
the physical distance between the sending and receiving machine. 



**Throughput**

"The quantity of data being sent and received within a fixed amount of time"



Both latency and throughput are related to the concept of bandwith


**Bandwith**

"The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path in a network"



-> bandwith describes the maximum possible amount of data being exchanged at a certain point in time 

-> latency describes the time it takes for a single packet to be transfered from one point to the other during an exchange 

-> throughput describes how many packets of data can be exchanged over a network in a fixed amount of time


 
**The relationhip between latency and bandwith**

A lowered amount of bandwith and an increased amount of latency will both decrease the
best possible speed of data transfered across a network. With increased bandwith the 
speed of transfering data increases as well. This effect is not diminished by a 
low level of latency.
