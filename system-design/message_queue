# message queues 

# benefits 
- can increase redundancy via persistent storage 
- can increase efficiency via batch processing 
- can be used for asynchronos processing of perhaps  
  compute intensive tasks
- can be used to break larger processes into several smaller 
  ones (i.e. Saga Pattern)


# example implementations
- kafka (event streaming)
- rabbitmq 
- redis 
- aws sqs
