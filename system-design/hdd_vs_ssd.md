SSD:

- small, random I/O operations 
- usable as bootable volume 

- use-cases:
  - transactional workloads 
  - critical application needing sustained 
    high IOPS performance 
  - large database workloads (OLTP)

- moderate to high cost

- dominant performance attribute: IOPS

HDD: 

- large, sequential I/O operations
- not usable as a bootable volume 


- use-cases:
  - large streaming workloads 
  - big data, data warehouses (OLAP),
    log processing
  - throughput oriente storage for large
    volumes of data that is infrequently 
    accessed 

- low cost

- dominant performance attribute: Throughput (MiB/s)
