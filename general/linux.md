# commands:

 "du -h [arg]" -> estimate data usage (size) of object, "-h" adds size units to output, arg is file or folder 

 "dkpg-query -L [arg]" -> show all files associated with downloaded debian package, arg is debian package name

 ! -> each apt package consists of binary files and a configuration file, using "--purge" deletes both, using
      "--remove" only deletes the binaries and leaves the configuration file
